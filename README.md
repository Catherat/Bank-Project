Nexus Bank Data Analysis Project


Nexus Bank, a leading financial institution, aims to optimize its operations and improve efficiency by leveraging the power of data analysis. As part of their strategic initiative, Nexus Bank has conducted campaigns with the goal of acquiring deposits. However, the board of directors expressed dissatisfaction with the current situation and seeks to enhance their understanding of customer behavior and demographics.

As a Data Scientist, I have been engaged by Nexus Bank to analyze their data and provide insights into customer behavior. The primary objective is to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and determine if customer demographics, such as age and educational level, influence their attitude toward defaulting. The board specifically wants to anticipate future customer behavior and assess the likelihood of deposits from customers.

Additionally, Nexus Bank aims to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns and develop targeted strategies to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing customer behaviors, loan trends, and campaign effectiveness, the bank seeks to optimize its operations, mitigate risks associated with loan defaults, and improve customer deposits.

This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for the Nexus Bank Data Analysis Project. It contains the code, documentation, and insights derived from the data analysis process. The project aims to provide actionable recommendations to Nexus Bank, enabling them to make informed decisions, enhance their marketing strategies, and improve overall business performance.
